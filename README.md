The Odin Project Assignments/Tasks

First "The Odin Project Assignment, here I am trying to refresh my HTML/CSS knowledge, mainly on the terminology on HTML/CSS and learn about GIT/GitHub and familiarise myself with using version controls. I am pretty proficient with HTML/CSS but not its terms (explaining what HTML is, etc). 

The main objective of this is to be able to explain to people the textbook explaination of what HTML/CSS and its purpose are, getting used to pushing with GIT and Github and refresh myself on Javascript and understand its concept better.
